# Part 1. Basics

## Section 01. Data types

### Exercise 01. Declaration of primitives

Declare a variable for each of the 8 primitive data types, without actually initializing them to a value.  
<sub>(you should end up with 8 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 02. Integer initialization

For each of the 4 primitive data types used to store integer numbers,
declare two variables without any initialization.
Using another statements, separate from declaration statements,
initialize one to the smallest value possible,
and the other - to the largest value possible.  
<sub>(you should end up with 16 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 03. Fractional initialization

For each of the 2 primitive data types used to store fractional numbers,
declare a variable without initialization.
Using another statement, initialize each of the variables to some value.  
<sub>(you should end up with 4 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 04. Letters and truth

For the primitive data type used to store characters,
declare two variables without intialization.
Using another statements, initialize each of the variables:

- one to 0x4F, but using the "character literal" notation.
- another to <k>, but using the hexadecimal value.

<sub>(you should end up with 4 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 05. Value the truth

For the primitive data type used to store truth values,
declare two variables without initialization.
Using another statements, intitialize them to 2 possible values (1 for each varialbe).
Then, reassign each of the two variables to the complimentary value.  
<sub>(you should end up with 6 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 06. Array declaration

For each of the 8 primitive data types, declare a variable which can be used
to point to a non-primitive collection of primitive variables.
Don't yet initialize (assign) / allocate any collections on the heap.  
<sub>(you should end up with 8 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 07. Array allocation & element initialization

For each of the 8 primitive data types, declare a variable which can be used
to point to a non-primitive collection of primitive variables.
The next step is to allocate an object on the heap for each of the variables.
Let each collection contain 2 elements.
The next step is to initialize each element for every collection to a random value.  
<sub>(you should end up with the staggering 32 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 08. Array literal

Same as the previous exercise, but you are free
to use a shortcut: the 'array literal' notation.  
<sub>(you should end up with the more feasible 8 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 09. String declaration

Declare a variable which can be used to point to a String object.
Don't intialize it / allocate any objects on the heap.  
<sub>(you should end up with a single statement`

### Exercise 10. String allocation & initialization

Declare a variable which can be used to point to a String object.
Allocate a new String object on a heap, give it a value "foo",
and assign its address to the variable.  
<sub>(you should end up with 2 statements)</sub>

### Exercise 11. String literal

Declare a variable with the type 'String' using the "String literal" notation. Initialize it to a value "bar".  
<sub>(you should end up with a single statement)</sub>

### Exercise 12. Cats and dogs

Declare a variable with a type String.
Initialize it to "Dogs are cool".
Change the value of the variable to "But cats are coolers."

### Exercise 13. Up and down the scale

Declare two arrays: the first one to containt _characters_,
the seconds one to contain _Strings_.
Initialize the first to the 7 musical notes:
( C, D, E, F, G, A, B )
Initialize the second to the 7 syllables:
( Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si )
Ask a user to pick a note by using a number between 1 .. 7,
print to him both names of the same note.
[access array elements by using the number]
