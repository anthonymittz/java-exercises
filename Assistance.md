# Part 1. Basics

## Section 01. Data types

1. You should end up with 8 statements, without any use of the assignment operator.

2. You should end up with 16 statements. First 8 are used to declare variables. Last 8 are used to intialize this variables to actual values.

3. You should end up with 4 statements. First 2 are declaration statements. Last 2 are assignment statements.

4. You should end up with 4 statements. First 2 are declaration statements. The next one uses 'character literal' notation (single quotes) to assign a value. The last one uses a hexadecimal integer value to assign a value. Use ASCII / UTF-8 tables to find the appropriate hex codes.

5. You should end up with 6 statements. First 2 are declaration statements. The next 2 are initialization to the 'truthy' and 'falsey' values, in no particular order. The last 2 are reassignment: the one that was 'falsey' becomes 'truthy', the other - vice versa.

6. You should end up with 8 statements. All of them are declaration statments. Don't use 'array literal' notation to assign values. Don't allocate any objects on the heap using the 'new' keyword.

7. You should end up with 32 statements. First 8 are declaration statements. Don't use 'array literal' notation to assign values. The next 8 are statements used for allocation of array objects on the heap (use the specified length). The next 16 statements are used to assign values to each of the array elements.

8. You should end up with 8 statements. They are declaration statements which include initialization using the 'array literal' notation (list of values in curly braces).

9. You should end up with 1 declaration statement.

10. You should end up with 2 statements. The first one is a declaration statement. The second one is an assignment of the address of a newly allocated String object. Use the new String(value) to initialize it to a value.

11. You should end up with 1 statement. Use the 'string literal' notation (characters that form the string enclosed in double quotes).

12. And there's no point arguing the contrary.

13. Use a java.util.Scanner class to get the user input and store it in a variable. Given that we work within the range 1..7, the variable is not necessary the _int_ type. Visual styling of the answer is up to you.
